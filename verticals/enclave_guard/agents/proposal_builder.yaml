# Proposal Builder Agent — Enclave Guard vertical
#
# Converts discovery call notes + company enrichment data into
# professional proposals/SOWs that close deals. This is the
# revenue multiplier: every meeting with a proposal is 5x more
# likely to convert.
#
# Pipeline: gather_context → research_company → generate_proposal →
#           human_review → finalize → deliver → END
#
# The Proposal Builder reads from the shared brain:
#   - Outreach insights (what messaging resonates)
#   - Appointment context (what was discussed)
#   - SEO authority topics (what positions us as experts)
#
# Proposal types:
#   sow               → Formal Statement of Work
#   one_pager          → Executive 1-page summary
#   executive_summary  → 2-3 page exec brief
#   full_proposal      → Comprehensive multi-section proposal
