Subject: How {{ company_industry }} companies handle security audits
---
{{ contact_first_name }},

I recently worked with a {{ company_industry }} company of about {{ company_size }} people that was in a similar position to {{ company_name }} — growing fast, handling sensitive data, but hadn't formalized their security posture yet.

We ran a 2-week security assessment that identified their top 10 risk areas and gave them a prioritized roadmap. Within 3 months, they used the results to pass a client's security review and close a deal that had been stuck.

I think there might be parallels with where {{ company_name }} is. Would 15 minutes next week be worth exploring that?

Best,
