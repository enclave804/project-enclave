Subject: {{ company_industry }} compliance — quick question
---
{{ contact_first_name }},

I work with {{ company_industry }} companies similar to {{ company_name }} on their security posture, and I've noticed a pattern: enterprise prospects and partners are increasingly asking for SOC2 reports and security documentation before signing.

For a {{ company_size }}-person company, the gap between "we handle security" and "we can prove it" is usually smaller than people think — but the cost of not having documentation ready when a deal depends on it is significant.

We run focused security assessments that give {{ company_industry }} companies a clear compliance roadmap. Most clients use the results to close their next enterprise deal faster.

Would it be worth a brief call to see if this applies to where {{ company_name }} is right now?

Best,
Jose
