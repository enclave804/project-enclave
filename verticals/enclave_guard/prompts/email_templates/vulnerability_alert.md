Subject: {{ company_name }} — security finding on {{ company_domain }}
---
{{ contact_first_name }},

While researching companies in the {{ company_industry }} space, I reviewed {{ company_domain }}'s public infrastructure and noticed a few things:

{% if vulnerabilities %}
{% for vuln in vulnerabilities[:3] %}
- {{ vuln.description }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- Several security headers are missing from your web properties
- Your SSL configuration could be strengthened
{% endif %}

These aren't unusual for companies at your stage, but they're the kind of gaps that come up during due diligence or after an incident.

At Enclave Guard, we run focused security audits for {{ company_industry }} companies — typically a 2-week engagement that gives you a clear picture of your exposure and a prioritized fix list.

Would a 15-minute call next week make sense to see if this is relevant for {{ company_name }}?

Best,
Jose
