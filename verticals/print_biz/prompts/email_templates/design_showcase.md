Subject: {{ company_name }} — bringing your designs to life in 3D

{{ contact_first_name }},

I came across {{ company_name }}'s work{% if recent_project %} — the {{ recent_project }} project caught my eye{% endif %}. The level of design detail stood out.

At PrintBiz, we work with architecture firms to turn CAD files into high-fidelity physical models:

- **48-hour turnaround** from file upload to finished model
- **SLA resin printing** for crisp detail at 1:100 or any scale
- **Professional finishing** — paint, landscaping, display bases

{% if portfolio_match %}
We recently printed {{ portfolio_match.project_type }} models for a {{ portfolio_match.industry }} firm — happy to share photos if useful.
{% else %}
We've printed everything from competition models to client presentation pieces for firms like yours.
{% endif %}

Would it make sense to send you a **free sample print** of one of your current designs? No commitment — just a chance to see the quality firsthand.

Best,
Jose
