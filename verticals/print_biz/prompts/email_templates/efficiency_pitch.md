Subject: {{ company_name }} — cutting model production time by 80%
---
{{ contact_first_name }},

I've been looking at how {{ company_industry }} firms handle physical model production, and most are still spending weeks on hand-built models or managing unreliable outsourced vendors.

We've helped firms similar to {{ company_name }} streamline this:

- **Upload a CAD file → receive a finished model in 48 hours**
- **60-80% cost reduction** vs. traditional model shops
- **Consistent quality** — no variance between runs
- **Scale on demand** — from single competition models to 20+ presentation sets

{% if company_size_range == "large" %}
For firms with {{ company_size }}+ employees, we offer project accounts with Net 30 terms and dedicated support.
{% endif %}

The firms that switch to 3D printing for their models typically see the ROI on the first project.

Worth a quick 15-minute call to see if this fits {{ company_name }}'s workflow?

Best,
Jose
