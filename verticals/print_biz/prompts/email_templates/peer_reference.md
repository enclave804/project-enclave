Subject: How {{ peer_company }} uses 3D printing for client wins
---
{{ contact_first_name }},

{% if peer_company %}
We recently worked with {{ peer_company }} on a {{ peer_project_type }} project — they used our 3D printed models for their client presentation and said it was the deciding factor in winning the project.
{% else %}
Several architecture firms we work with tell us the same thing: presenting a physical 3D model alongside their renders consistently helps them win projects.
{% endif %}

A few things their team mentioned:

- Models arrived in 48 hours — faster than their in-house team could build one
- The SLA resin detail was sharper than anything they'd seen from traditional model shops
- Clients passed the models around the boardroom — "you can't do that with a screen"

{{ contact_first_name }}, would it be worth seeing what a model of one of {{ company_name }}'s current projects would look like? We offer a free first print so you can evaluate quality with zero risk.

Best,
