  objection_playbook:
    too_expensive: "Our architectural models start at $150. We offer a free sample print of your design so you can evaluate quality before committing."
    already_have_printer: "Many firms with in-house FDM printers use us for high-detail SLA/SLS jobs. We complement your setup for client-facing presentation models."
